This is file hub with some cool tools to make terminal interfaces [Python based]
* This is not a lib, just clone the branch of the tools you want and be happy!
* The only requirement is Python 3.11
* Some feature may not be available on Windows, if that's the case. Open an issue and implement it!

Star it if you also love ASCII <3

## Tools

"React like" classes to make TUIs using components. These classes will handle the refresh part and serve an API for you then you can just control the current state of the TUI screen!
